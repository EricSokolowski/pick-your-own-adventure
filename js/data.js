    story: `In a world full of great kingdoms and legions of monsters, how can one man make a difference?

    The world as you know it has changed in the past few years.  King Garner, ‘The Beast’, as he's affectionately known,  has an iron grip on the kingdom at large.  Laws have been harshened to the deathly extreme and resources for the lesser fortunate are stiffened.  Patrol outside the city walls has been limited due to a defunded Nights Guard.  That money was allocated to monthly tourneys by order of the King himself.  The people who are forced to live outside of the city are rewarded with bandit raids and attacks from foul beasts.  You are one of these less fortunate.  The air has been thinning around you, life tightens its grasp on your neighbors and people begin to become desperate for help.  You yourself would have been damned if not for your father,  His name is Lambard and as ex-kingsguard, he has the tools to protect you.  But he's getting old, 65 maybe even 70 he wishes to keep it a secret to not reveal how little time he actually has left.  Today is its own, however, and there is work to do…  Your father has tasked you with collecting firewood from the Bloom Marsh, a wooded swamp about a mile west of the homestead.`,

    chapter: `To the Swamp`,
    story: `The trek to the swamp is one you’ve taken every time your father has asked but the sum is one you can't begin to count.  You’ve got your rusty ax and a wheelbarrow to cart off your spoils.  You do have to be careful in this swamp,  treants can adeptly blend into the background but you’ve got an eye for them.  The tell is that the shade of the leaves is always different from the average tree.  Thankfully, they’re rather passive if left to their own devices.  Otherwise, you’d be in trouble because at a quick glance you’d see 2 to 3 of them in your immediate area.  You come across what seems like a worthy tree. you give it a knock and it sounds completely hollow.  The knock sends a squirrel from up the tree berserk.  The squirrel lands on you and after a brief tussle with the miniature devil, it runs off into a small cave.  All these times you’ve been in the swamp and you’ve never seen this cave before.  It draws your intrigue…`,

    story: `There’s no way this tree can be this hollow, can it?  You’ve double-checked and it's no Treant.  At this point, the prospect of firewood is a lesser thought than simply cracking open the tree and taking a peak.  You swing your ax with as much force as you can muster.  The tree is oldy firm, firmer than you’d think for a tree of this density.  It takes more swings than anticipated but one ‘timber’ later it’s fallen.  You’re shocked to look it over and see nothing but deep blackness inside the tree.  There’s a hole in the center of this tree.  Leading down however far you can imagine.  Reason tells you to cut down another tree and leave.  The adventurous spark in you desires to descend down this hole and find whatever is at the bottom.`,

    chapter: `Delve into the Hole`,
    story: `A quick dive into a hollow tree never hurt anyone, right?  If anything goes wrong you do have your ax.  That’s at least what you tell yourself to retrieve the courage from the bottom of your stomach.  You know deep down that felling a tree and a beast are two mightily different tasks.  Climbing down a tree is no more difficult than climbing up one but you quickly lose the light.  As the sunlight gives up on you this trip is seeming more and more ludicrous but there's no point going back up now.  You find the bottom with more ease than you were hoping for but less than you were anticipating.  Strangely, The floor feels not of wood but of stone and you can see, from what is appearing to be a corner of a tunnel you are now in, a glimmer of blue ethereal light.  You feel your way around and to your confusion, you find yourself on one end of a tunnel.  There are fine wooden supports engraved with some sort of design you could see only if you were blind.  You make your way to the end of this hall and peak around the corner.  The light fades to a meer glow off of a bow, arrows, and a set of armor.  The bow looks light and fluid, vestiges of stags and wild beasts cover it from one end to another.  The arrows are thin and bendy but impossible to break.  The armor looks thin and breathable but there’s not a scratch on it.  The equipment is spotless but this hideaway looks abandoned.  Nothing in here but dead air and the occasional bug.`,

    story: `Minimum a finer inspection wouldn’t hurt.  Approaching the bow you become more and more drawn to it.  When you come within a foot of it you acquire this feeling like you’ve used this weapon your whole life, as it belongs to you.  If your mind wasn’t so enveloped in the beauty of the bow, and the craftsmanship, you would have noticed every step you take the bow's glow brightens.  You grab the bow and immediately you feel your senses sharpening.  You’re sharp as a tack, it's borderline unsettling.  You turn to the armor and at a glance, it’s much smaller now.  It’s somehow adjusted in size…  You begin to adorn the armor and it fits perfectly, no heavier than a cotton shirt and harder than a steel breastplate.  The arrow quiver fits perfectly over your shoulder as you somehow expected it to.  You pull an arrow out of the quiver and another one appears right in its place.  Attempting to place the arrow back into the quiver leaves nothing of that arrow but a trace of blue sand which falls straight down in a pile on the cold stone floors.  Exiting this hideaway twice as fast as you entered, you appear back out in the swamp.  It’s later than you expected but you still have time to gather some of this wood and head home.  You begin to collect the firewood somewhat absent-mindedly, your thoughts now focus on what you’re going to tell your father about how you acquired all of this gear.  A moment later the hairs on the back of your neck abruptly stand, you spin around into action and reflexively take arms and knock an arrow like you’ve done it every day since birth.  A giant crocodile has gotten your scent and has been waiting for your arrival.  You turn to face the beast and in what seems like slow motion you make a decision.`,

You scurry to the back of the tunnel to catch your breath for a moment.  You’re horrified to see that the Crocodile is forcing its way down the tree.  Your heart drops, knowing there’s nowhere else to run. The few shots you get off before the beast closes on you are not enough.`,

    story: `The tree can wait,  you have unfinished business, you tell yourself jokingly.  In reality, though you’re more curious about the cave itself.  How could it be that you’ve never spotted it until now?  You walk up to the very lip of the cave and collect yourself for a moment tightening the grasp on your ax as you do so.  Only a few steps into the bleak cave and you’re already rapidly losing sunlight.  At this point, you just want to see the end of it and return to your duties.  That’s what crosses your mind anyways until you see the slight glimmer of light in an off-shoot of the cave.  You ever so quietly approach as close as you can without getting seen, turning only your head around the corner to get a glimpse inside.  To your surprise, there’s nothing more than an empty table with two cups and some moldy bread.  Leaning against the table there’s a giant maul, it’s a good 3/4ths the size of your body and looks impossibly heavy.  For possibly no other reason than a brief test of your might, you walk over to the maul, and with every muscle in your body straining you cannot pick the maul up.  That is at first, but the more you try to heave the primitive weapon the stronger you feel yourself becoming until you’re able to heave it over your shoulder.  The feeling of this newfound strength is almost nauseating.  You attempt to pull out a chair to sit and regain yourself for a moment and you nearly fling the furniture against the wall.  While gathering yourself, you take a look around.  This place is very obviously abandoned.  Whatever was in these cups is hardened and the bread on the table would be reduced to ask if not in the darkness of this cave.  You think that this maul is as good as yours if you want it.
